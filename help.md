# 1. Search

Search for transactions by typing a transaction id, a raw transaction, or a keyword into the search bar.

<br>

## a. Search by transaction id

if a transaction is already on the bitcoin network, enter the transaction ID to search for it.

## b. Search by raw transaction hex

You can even enter a full raw transaction hex into the search bar.

What is cool about this?

This means TXT lets you explore ANY kind of Bitcoin transaction. This includes not just transactions on the blockchain, but **offchain transactions**, **unsigned transactions**, etc.

For example, try copy and pasting the following raw transaction hex into the search bar above (it's an unsigned transaction):

```
010000000001000000000000000093006a2231394878696756345179427633744870515663554551797131707a5a56646f4175744c553c68746d6c3e3c626f64793e3c68313e706f737420746f203c6120687265663d2768747470733a2f2f622e62697464622e6e6574776f726b273e423a2f2f3c2f613e3c2f68313e3c2f626f64793e3c2f68746d6c3e09746578742f68746d6c057574662d3806622e68746d6c00000000
```

# 2. Save

Once you have a transaction, you can save them simply by pressing the "Save" button at the top left corner of a transaction page.

Feel free to add a **description (supports markdown)** and **tags** so you can easily find it later. Both the description and the tags will be full-text indexed and searchable.

Once you save them, you can share your saved transaction as a permalink.

# 4. Try now!

<br>

## 1. Try transaction ID

Try copy and pasting the transaction id into the search bar:

```
ef21e71d00b9fce174222e679640b09e29ac8a55f321c93e64b16cc3109959f8
```

<br>

## 2. Try raw transaction hex

Or try entering a raw transaction hex into the search bar:

```
010000000001000000000000000093006a2231394878696756345179427633744870515663554551797131707a5a56646f4175744c553c68746d6c3e3c626f64793e3c68313e706f737420746f203c6120687265663d2768747470733a2f2f622e62697464622e6e6574776f726b273e423a2f2f3c2f613e3c2f68313e3c2f626f64793e3c2f68746d6c3e09746578742f68746d6c057574662d3806622e68746d6c00000000
```

Why is this exciting? This raw transaction **DOES NOT EXIST** on the blockchain.

If you look closely you'll realize it can never be on the blockchain since it's an unsigned transaction.

This means you can save this template and come back to use it later. All ou need to do is sign the saved transaction and broadcast.
